# Earthlink App
## Project for CS4278 - Principles of Software Engineering

This project is a new social networking app built in Android Studio that emphasizes location-based messaging using the Google Maps API. This unique feature enables users to leave messages tied to specific physical locations that can be accessed by others within a small range. The intention is to integrate conventional social networking features with geolocation to create a richer and more contextual user experience.

This project is developed in Android Studio using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android.
